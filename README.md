# My Fit AI

Your AI-powered fitness companion for personalized workouts, nutrition, and health tracking.

**By Jeevan Sidhardha Movva**

## Firebase (after rebranding)

The app uses **com.jeeva.fitai** (Android) and **com.jeeva.fitai** (iOS/macOS) as package/bundle IDs. To use Firebase with this app:

1. In [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), open your project (or create one).
2. **Android:** Add an app with package name `com.jeeva.fitai`, then download the new `google-services.json` into `android/app/`.
3. **iOS:** Add an app with bundle ID `com.jeeva.fitai`, then download the new `GoogleService-Info.plist` into `ios/Runner/`.
4. Run `dart run flutterfire configure` to regenerate `lib/firebase_options.dart` if needed.
